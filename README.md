## What is this?
Do you have more than 6 or 7 addons and you cannot see the link in your control panel bar? Well, this addon is for you.
This addon will create a dropdown menu from your list of addons. Why?, so you can have lots of addons and still be able to see them using the dropdown.

## Changelog
1.0.1 - Updated styling per [Mike Martin's](https://github.com/mikemartin) suggestion. Separated adons from core functions
1.0.0 - Initial release

## Installation
Copy the folder to the `_add-ons` folder and rename it to `cpbar_dropdown`.
